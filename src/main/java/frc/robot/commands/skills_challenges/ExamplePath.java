//	By inheriting from SequentialCommandGroup, all the Commands you put in the constructor will be executed in sequence by default.
//	ParallelCommandGroup, for example, will execute them all simultaneously. (There are more than these two group types)

//	HOWEVER, Command Groups are "recursively composable", meaning that you can have groups inside groups.
//	This is what makes Command-Based code so powerful, because you can quickly write very complex autons.
public class ExamplePath extends SequentialCommandGroup
{
	//	Every Command or Command Group needs to take in the subsystems it uses as arguments.
	//	For example, this command uses the drivetrain, so we pass in a Mecanum argument.
	//	This is called "dependency injection" in technical terms.
	public ExamplePath(Mecanum dt)
	{
		//	The addCommands method will add commands to the given Command Group.
		//	You can pass in as many commands as you want to as arguments.
		//	I think it's neat to separate it into multiple lines, rather than having the whole group in one line.
		addCommands
		(
			new DriveToDistanceCommand(1, dt),
			new TurnToAngleCommand(90, dt)
			// This will drive 1 meter forward and turn 90 degrees to the right
		);

		//	The constructor doesn't even need to do anything else! Just addCommands() and you're good
	}

			//	https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/convenience-features.html#runcommand
			//	RunCommand takes a method *reference* as a parameter. A method reference looks like objectName::methodName.
			//	In the link up there, they used a lambda instead of a method reference. You can look up what that is, but it's not important here.
			//	A RunCommand would be used for a simple command that doesn't need its own file.

	//	Here's an example of one of those "recursively composed" command groups.
	//	You guys shouldn't need this, but I'm just showing you because it's cool.
